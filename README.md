# The-Cloud

Hello!

This repository is a collection of the code copied from a project I worked on from glitch.com (working website here: https://the-cloud-explained.glitch.me/)

This website was used as a visual aid in a presentation about the implementation of the cloud. This included different types of services, tradeoffs, security issues, and the how the cloud actually functions.
